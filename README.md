# FrameProcessor

A [Micro-Manager](https://micro-manager.org/) plugin that can process stack images in time. The processing can be applied in real-time (live mode) or during an acquisition (MDA).

This plugin has been inspired from the excellent FrameAverager plugin from [OpenPolScope](http://www.openpolscope.org/pages/MMPlugin_Frame_Averager.htm) available on github at https://github.com/LC-PolScope/Micro-Manager-Addons.

The motivation to create this plugin was to make it compatible with Micro-Manager 2 and also add more processing operations.

# Features

This plugin can perform several classic operations during **live** or **MDA** such as `mean`, `sum`, `max` and `min` on a certain number of frames defined by the user.
